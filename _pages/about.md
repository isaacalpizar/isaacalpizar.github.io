I am an assistant professor at the [Software Technology for Learning and Teaching](https://www.uu.nl/en/research/software/software-technology-for-learning-and-teaching) group of the [department of Information and Computing Sciences](https://www.uu.nl/en/organisation/department-of-information-and-computing-sciences) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/) (80%). I am also an associate professor at the [Information Technology Administrator](https://www.tec.ac.cr/administracion-tecnologia-informacion) program at [Instituto Tecnológico de Costa Rica](https://www.tec.ac.cr/en) (25%).

My research interests are computing education, generative AI in education, computational thinking, the integration of artificial intelligence in educational settings, and extraction of knowledge. I love helping students learn, no matter their background — whether they’re completely new to programming or already experienced.
